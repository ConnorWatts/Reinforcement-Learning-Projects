# Reinforcement-Learning-Projects

This repo contains notebooks for a selection of Reinforcement Learning projects. Below are descriptions of each of each of the projects and links to the corresponding repositories;

[**Pairs Trading RL**](https://github.com/ConnorWatts/Pairs-Trading-RL)

This repository contains an PyTorch implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to Pairs Trading. In this work we implement a Deep Q Network algorithm to determine when the "spread" between two cointegrated stocks will converge. 

[**Transformer based RL Portfolio Manager**](https://github.com/ConnorWatts/TRL-Portfolio-Management)

This repository contains an PyTorch implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to Financial Portfolio Management. It is motivated by [**A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Financial Portfolio Management Problem**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10059) by Jiang et. al. 2017. In this work we implement two deep reinforcement learning algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) to allocate portions of a fund to different financial products with the goal of maximising returns. Additionally we aim to investigate the use of Transformers for the neutral network structures. 

[**Rubiks Cube RL**](https://github.com/ConnorWatts/Rubiks-RL)

This repository contains an PyTorch implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to solving a Rubik's Cube. In this work we implement a Deep Q Network algorithm to determine what moves to make in order the solve the cube. Additionally we investigate the feasibility of the solution with the dimension of the cube is increased.
